How to Run:
	1)  Run the UserInterface.jar file
		i) On the first run, the program will take a long time.  This is because it is creating a temporary US Census database. It will start much faster when run the next time.
	
How to Use:
	1) The search bar lists all of the townships and cities in Michigan.  It can be searched through by typing in part of the name of a townhip or city
		and clicking the arrow located to the right of the search bar. From the drop down menu, one of the names can be selected by clicking on the name from the drop down menu.
	2) The query buttons on the left side of the window select which statistics will be displayed about the township. Any number of buttons may be selected to view all wanted statistics.
	3) Once your desired buttons are selected and a township/city is selected, press the "go" button to display the results in a table.
	4) If you would like your data to be shown visibly, you can press the "Graph" button and you will see a pop-up that will display your desired data graphically.
	5) If you want to see multiple townships/cities, then you can enter another entry into the search bar and hit "go" again, and it will be added to the table
		i) You cannot select two places with differing query buttons selected.
		   For example, you can't search 'Crystal Falls Township' for Population and 'Oakland Charter Township' for Population and Median Age By Sex. 
		   If you want to increase the amount of data that you would like, then hit the "Clear" button under the table and select the data you want and add the entries again.
	6) If you enter an invalid place the table will give an error message.
	    If this happens, double check that your entry was correct.
